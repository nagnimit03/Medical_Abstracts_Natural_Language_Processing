        "PubMed Abstract - In this project I will be creating a Natural Language Processing model that can map a public medical abstracts to a pertinent label. In this project I will be replicating the model in the research paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071 and will try to beat the research's paper metrics by using Tensorflows. This dataset will be containing approximately 200,000 medical abstracts\n",
        "\n",
        "Problem Statement - Whenever we come across a medical research paper and go through its public abstract it is difficult to interpret it as there are many technical terms present in the abstract. As a result we do not what is the background of the study , what methods they will be. using or what are the results and conclusions. These all make a medical abstract difficult to interpret.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion - If there is a model that can break the abstract of a research into several labels like background , method ,conclusion etc it would become readabble as well as easier to interpret. Thus , our goal here would be able to make a natural language processing that can solve a many to noe sequence problem and break down a medical abstract into labels making it readable and easier to interpret\n",
